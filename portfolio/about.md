# About me

First of all, thanks for wanting to know more about me. I appreciate your visit! ðŸŽ‰

I'll talk about myself as a person and professionally; I hope it shows you a little bit of who I am. ðŸ™‚

Please feel free to contact me anytime, and I'll be happy to chat about an opportunity and how I can be part of something amazing.

## Intro

Hi, I'm a Software Engineer based in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I've been in touch with tech for more than **15 years** now, and I'm always learning something new; I've decided to focus my career on frontend development and have almost **7 years** of professional experience. I excel at ensuring a high-quality user experience and writing code that is performant, easy to understand, and reusable. As expected, I have my preferred tools, frameworks and methods, but I also understand that I don't know everything and can learn.

I consider myself a problem solver who is constantly learning new stuff to **get ~~sh~~it done**.

## Life

I live in a small town called **AguaÃ­**, in the countryside of **SÃ£o Paulo**, with my wife **MarÃ­lia** and two sausage dogs, **Cacau and Tobias**. We have been married since 2019, and our relationship is based on mutual respect, trust, and communication. She is a neuropsychologist and is also constantly learning and working hard; I'm glad we both have this mindset of progressing while complementing each other in other areas.

Fun fact: We are the same age; she was born on 04/13/1991, and I was born on 08/13/1991.

### Having fun

I enjoy playing video games and spending quality time with my family in my spare time. And we both love traveling! Our next dream destination is Machu Picchu - Peru.

Don't worry; Cacau and Tobias also get their vacation when we travel, staying at their grandma's house (we think they like it better than their own home)

## My beginning in tech

> Note: I feel extremely lucky to come from a humble family that, despite not having any level of degree, always motivated me to study and work hard to grab the chances life gave me.

I started studying programming in 2009, and back then, I had quite a busy schedule: I was in high school in the morning, working as an intern (not IT-related) in the afternoon, and at night, I traveled to a nearby city to study a professionalizing course in informatics.

Along with other subjects like basic English and entrepreneurship, I learned **Pascal** and then **Delphi** for desktop development, **HTML, CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**.
